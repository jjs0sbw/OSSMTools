<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>John Warfield created structural modeling in the 1970's and refined the techniques over a period of years. As structural modeling developed, the techniques associated with Unified Program Planning (UPP), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Interactive Management (IM) were designed, refined and tested. These three modeling techniques (UPP, ISM and IM) are distinct individual methods and approaches. However, over a period of time, the distinction between these three methods has been lost. Reestablishment of the clear distinctions between and among these three approaches is a key objective of the OSSM Tools development.</p>

<p>Interactive Management:</p>
<p>IM is the last of the three structural modeling techniques to be developed and includes aspects of UPP and ISM. IM uses an overall holistic analysis approach that provides structured operations and templates to encapsulate the UPP and ISM methods to produce the IM products and outcomes.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of computer support activities associated with IM tasks. The first type is a collection of user management, content management and content presentation tasks. The second type is the application of logical rules to the detailed evaluation of a specific IM task or phase. This documents long term goal is the development and communication of the requirements for both of these basic computer support activities. The logical rule support activity component will be developed first and the other computer support activities will be addressed as time and resources allow.</p>

<p>Interactive Management Phases:</p>
<p>IM is organized around three phases 1) planning phase, 2) workshop phase and 3) followup phase. Each individual phase addresses group activities necessary to increase group communication, interaction and task focus. In general, IM is grounded on the the managerial functions of intelligence, design and choice. Based on these managerial functions, IM tasks produce definitions, designs and a preferred design approach. </p>

<p>The planning phase creates a organized, structured collection of tasks and activities focused on producing the required results with the minimum expenditure of resources. There are many tasks and activities that can be accomplished using computer based data templates, communication processes and databases. However, the ISM logic based computer system does not appear to have a role in the planning phase.</p>

<p>The workshop phase is executed based on the plans and preparations made in the planning phase. Organizational resources are minimized during the workshop phase using the current plan to generate ideas, clarify and evaluate these ideas, structure the ideas and interpret the ideas and their related structure. The ISM logic based computer system is used in the workshop phase.</p>

<p>The followup phase of IM can take many different forms depending on the IM activity topics and objectives. Specific types of followup phases are, definition project followup, design alternatives followup </p>
