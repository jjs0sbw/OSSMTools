<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>John Warfield created structural modeling in the 1970's and refined the techniques over a period of years. As structural modeling developed, the techniques associated with Unified Program Planning (UPP), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Interactive Management (IM) were designed, refined and tested. These three modeling techniques (UPP, ISM and IM) are distinct individual methods and approaches. However, over a period of time, the distinction between these three methods has been lost. Reestablishment of the clear distinctions between and among these three approaches is a key objective of the OSSM Tools development.</p>

<p>Interactive Management:</p>
<p>IM is the last of the three structural modeling techniques to be developed and includes aspects of UPP and ISM. IM uses an overall holistic analysis approach that provides structured operations and templates to encapsulate the UPP and ISM methods to produce the IM products and outcomes.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of computer support activities associated with IM tasks. The first type is a collection of user management, content management and content presentation tasks. The second type is the application of logical rules to the detailed evaluation of a specific IM task or phase. This documents long term goal is the development and communication of the requirements for both of these basic computer support activities. The logical rule support activity component will be developed first and the other computer support activities will be addressed as time and resources allow.</p>

<p>Interactive Management Phases:</p>
<p>IM is organized around three phases 1) planning phase, 2) workshop phase and 3) followup phase. Each individual phase addresses group activities necessary to increase group communication, interaction and task focus. In general, IM is grounded on the the managerial functions of intelligence, design and choice. Based on these managerial functions, IM tasks produce definitions, designs and a preferred design approach. </p>

<p>The planning phase creates a organized, structured collection of tasks and activities focused on producing the required results with the minimum expenditure of resources. There are many tasks and activities that can be accomplished using computer based data templates, communication processes and databases. However, the ISM logic based computer system does not appear to have a role in the planning phase.</p>

<p>The workshop phase is executed based on the plans and preparations made in the planning phase. Organizational resources are minimized during the workshop phase using the current plan to generate ideas, clarify and evaluate these ideas, structure the ideas and interpret the ideas and their related structure. The ISM logic based computer system is used in the workshop phase.</p>

<p>The followup phase of IM can take many different forms depending on the IM activity topics and objectives. Specific types of followup phases are, definition project followup, design alternatives followup and a combination of a definition and alternatives followups. The ISM logic based computer system does not appear to be used in the followup phases. However, many standard system engineering decision making and alternative analysis computer programs appear to have a stron grole in the followup phase.</p>

<p>General Open Source Structural Modeling (OSSM) Tools Creation Approach:</p>
<p>The initial evaluation of the mathematics of structure and associated computer based algorithms was completed by Systems Concepts in 2015 and the work archived in the following Github repositories:</p>

<p>  <a href="https://github.com/jjs0sbw/INCOSE_2015" class="uri">https://github.com/jjs0sbw/INCOSE_2015</a></p>
<p>  <a href="https://github.com/jjs0sbw/smp" class="uri">https://github.com/jjs0sbw/smp</a></p>

<p>The next version of the OSSM Tools is based on Vue.js. This version will be based on the mathematical logic in the existing Github repositories and the requirement to support idea creation, evaluation, analysis and selection. Individuals are identified and assigned their own specific accounts. The requirements associated with tracking individual contributions including ideas and voting are part of the next software version.</p>

<p>The OSSMTools software architecture is modular and designed to allow incremental design, development and deployment of any requested system function. Appendix 2, “GMU ISM Software” of “A Handbook of Interactive Management” is used to guide the initial operational and functional requirements. Three functional commands are available in the GMU ISM Software to support a specific structuring application. These three commands are: 1) DOMODEL, 2) DOCLUS, and 3) DOPRIOR. The logic and mathematics behind these commands is extensively evaluated in the referenced Github repositories. These evaluations are not repeated in this document.</p>

<p>A wide range of natural language structuring relationships are addressed by the GMU ISM commands. The authors developed the augmented model-exchange isomorphism (AMEI) to provide a standard framework for relationship categorization and evaluation. The AMEI is available at: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272238246_Augmented_Model-Exchange_Isomorphism_Version_11" class="uri">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272238246_Augmented_Model-Exchange_Isomorphism_Version_11</a></p>

<p>Other relationship characteristics and attributes were developed by the authors to support a more rigorous and detailed natural language relationship analysis and evaluation approach. The publications and documents associated with the relationship characteristics and attributes development are located on ResearchersGate at: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph_Simpson3/contributions" class="uri">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph_Simpson3/contributions</a></p>

<p>The DOMODEL command is presented as the most general command which may be applied in any ISM structuring application. The authors have not successfully created an open source software DOMODEL function that has the capability to consistently reproduce the same outcomes. The new open source software, produced from this requirements document, will focus on providing an acceptable open source DOMODEL command.</p>

<p>The DOCLUS command is used when the natural language relationship contains a symmetric logical property. The authors created an open-source DOCLUS software program that consistently reproduces the same outcome. </p>

<p>The DOPRIOR command is used when the natural language relationship contains an asymmetric logical property. The authors created an open-source DOPRIOR software program that consistently reproduces the same outcome.</p>

<p>The DOCLUS and DOPRIOR command logic may be combined to produce an application that addresses the creation of an ordered sequence of clusters. The authors documented this types of open-source program creation and application in the material found on ResearchGate and Github.</p>

<p>The new open-source software architecture development process contains several concurrent activity threads. These concurrent activity threads are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements development</li>
<li>Software architecture design</li>
<li>Software code production</li>
<li>Software unit, integration and functional test</li>
</ul>

<p>Requirements for the DOCLUS, DOPRIOR and DOMODEL are addressed in the following sections, in that order.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source DOCLUS Command Requirements:</strong> </p>
<p>The DOCLUS command name and title was changed to “Cluster Objects Into Classes,” in the open-source software available on Github. The initial screen for the software is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Figure 1, Existing Initial Screen</p>

<p>The OSSMTools initial screen will have similar content but the text boxes for entering the initial matrix size and the display buttons will be removed and replaced with a start button. Once the Cluster Objects Into Classes start button has been selected a new screen that allows the entry, editing and deletion of the objects of interest will be displayed.</p>
